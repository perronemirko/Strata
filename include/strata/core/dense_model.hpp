// include/strata/core/dense_model.hpp - a DENSE qwen35 model on Strata's kernels: Qwen3.8-27B (unsloth GGUF).
//
// WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE RUNNER AND NOT A MODE OF `strata`.  The MoE engine is specialised end to end
// (check_architecture: `qwen4exp`, 2560 wide, 48 blocks; expert arena; QSA indexer; hyper-connections; PLE;
// n-gram table).  A dense model has none of it, so `strata` refuses its GGUF at the first guard.  What the two
// models DO share is the GDN mixer (S = 128, 16 QK heads, 48 V heads, 10240 conv channels, d_conv 4), the
// quantized GEMVs, RoPE and the attention output gate.  Those kernels are reused as they are.
//
// THE MODEL (qwen35, 64 layers + 1 MTP block in the file, n_embd 5120, n_ff 17408), per layer:
//
//     xn = rms_norm(x, attn_norm)
//     GDN layer  (3 of every 4):  qkv, z = attn_qkv xn, attn_gate xn
//                                 conv+silu -> l2(q), l2(k) -> alpha, beta = ssm_alpha xn, ssm_beta xn
//                                 gate = softplus(alpha + dt) * ssm_a ; beta = sigmoid(beta)
//                                 o = delta-rule(state, q, k, v) ; y = rms_norm(o) * ssm_norm * SiLU(z)
//                                 mix = ssm_out y
//     attention layer (1 of 4):   q_full, k, v = attn_q xn, attn_k xn, attn_v xn      q_full = [q | gate] per head
//                                 q, k = rope(rms_norm_head(q), rms_norm_head(k))       24 Q heads, 4 KV heads, 256
//                                 attn = softmax(q K^T / sqrt(256)) V ; attn *= sigmoid(gate)
//                                 mix = attn_output attn
//     x += mix
//     x += ffn_down( silu(ffn_gate xn2) * ffn_up xn2 ),   xn2 = rms_norm(x, post_attention_norm)
//
// then h = rms_norm(x, output_norm) and logits = output h.  The GGUF carries ONE extra block after the 64
// (qwen35.nextn_predict_layers = 1): the multi-token-prediction head.  It is NOT part of the trunk.
//
// COLUMNS.  run() takes up to kMaxCols consecutive tokens at once.  The GEMVs (which read every weight once per
// call, so they are where the time goes) then serve all the columns; the order-dependent parts (conv, delta-rule
// state, KV append) walk the columns one by one, so the result equals feeding the tokens through step() in
// sequence.  That is what makes both a fast prefill and speculative verification possible.
//
// MTP.  With `with_mtp` the block is loaded and the model can propose the next token (mtp_draft); the caller
// verifies it with a two-column run() that snapshots the recurrent state after column 0, and rollback() undoes
// column 1 if the proposal was wrong.  The MTP block keeps its own KV cache and is fed every position (mtp_ingest).
