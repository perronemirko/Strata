// include/strata/kernels/dense_kernels.hpp - the kernels a DENSE qwen35 model (Qwen3.8-27B) needs and the MoE
// engine does not have.
//
// The GDN recurrence, the quantized GEMVs (native_mmvq), RoPE, the per-head RMSNorm and the attention output gate
// already exist and are reused by src/core/dense_model.cpp.  What was missing, because the MoE model routes its
// attention through the QSA indexer and has no plain FFN:
//
//   * an RMSNorm that writes to a second buffer          (dense_rms_norm)
//   * SwiGLU                                             (dense_swiglu)
//   * an F32 GEMV for the two tiny GDN projections       (dense_gemv_f32)   ssm_alpha / ssm_beta, n_out = 48
//   * a K/V cache and full causal attention over it      (dense_kv_append, dense_attn_decode)
//
// The attention is a split-K flash decode: one block per (head, chunk of 256 cells) keeps an online softmax
// (m, l, acc) per warp, the warps are merged inside the block, and a second kernel merges the chunks.  Every
// query head reads the K/V head `h / (n_head / n_kv)` (GQA: contiguous groups, the same map qsa.hpp pins).
//
// KV layout: [n_kv][max_ctx][head_dim] IEEE half, so one head's cells are contiguous.
